Option 4: Original Idea

That’s right. You are creative and I believe in you. Feel free to pitch an original idea for the mini-project.

Must-Haves:

Deploy to Heroku
Authentication/Authorization
One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
Styling

Things to Consider

If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we’ve touched over the last week. For example:

TDD - model and feature tests
CRUD
ReST-ful routes
Well structured relational database design
Rails helpers
Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
Authentication
Authorization
Optional Extensions

Implement Twitter, Github, or Facebook OAuth login
Use HAML for your views
TDD using RSpec instead of Test::Unit

- 4 types of users: admin, managers, players, and visitor
- Admins can edit anything
- Managers can edit team info
- Users can only edit their profile and view everything else

  -League Standings
  -Player Stats
  -Team Schedules
